So I've managed to get a simple scanner running thanks to a tutorial video. It scans a range of ports on a given host and reports if they are open or closed.
I have noticed that ive gotten erros when trying to scan a large range of ports. I'm not sure what that is about

So it seems like there is an issue with trying to have muliplte threads running when using scapy. im not 100% sure but it seems to be that since im scanning multiple
ports at once with threadsm it causes scapy to not scan properly.

bad fix: So if i limit the amount fo workers to 1 there are no errors but it takes a long time 

Next step is to banner grab

todo: look into using -sV for banner grabbing when i have time
